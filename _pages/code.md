## Stellar Spectroscopy

### Chem-I-Calc: The Chemical Information Calculator

Chem-I-Calc is an open source python package for evaluating the chemical information content of resolved star spectroscopy. It takes advantage of the Fisher information matrix and the Cramér-Rao inequality to quickly calculate the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs), which give the best theoretically achievable precision from a set of observations. Use it to quickly forecast the expected chemical abundance precision of your upcoming observation, instrument, or survey!
* Install it from [Github](https://github.com/NathanSandford/Chem-I-Calc)
* Find the documentation [here](https://chem-i-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Read the paper on the methods [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...24S/abstract)

## Galactic Chemical Evolution

### ChemWAF & fanCE
Python packages wrapping the analytic chemical evolution model from [Weinberg et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837..183W/abstract)
* Read about its application to the ultra faint dwarf galaxy Eridanus II in [Sandford et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.530.2315S/abstract)
* Read about its application to the massive elliptical galaxies in [Gountanis et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240707971M/abstract)
* Download ChemWAF from [Github](https://github.com/NathanSandford/ChemWAF)
* Download fanCE from [Github](https://github.com/nmgountanis/fanCE)

### Chempy
Flexible one-zone chemical enrichment model developed in [Rybizki et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...605A..59R/abstract).
* Read more about it [here](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2017/09/aa30522-17/aa30522-17.html)
* Download it from [Github](https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Chempy)

### Chempy-Widget
Interactive iPython widget created for Jan Rybizki's Chempy. This is a great tool for building an intuition for how a system's star formation history is imprinted on its chemical composition.
* Download it from [Github](https://github.com/NathanSandford/Chempy-Widget)
* Play with it [online](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NathanSandford/Chempy-Widget/master?filepath=chempy_widget.ipynb)
