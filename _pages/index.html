I am a sixth- and final-year graduate student in Prof. Dan Weisz's group in the UC Berkeley Department of Astronomy. I study the evolution of Local Group dwarf galaxies using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data, galactic chemical enrichment models, and stellar atmosphere and evolution models. 

I grew up in Santa Clara, CA where I attended Adrian C. Wilcox High School. I graduated from Pomona College in 2017 with a BA in Physics and Astronomy with a minor in Mathematics from. While at Pomona, I studied the effects of feedback physics on the radial metallicity gradients of disk galaxies with Dr. Yu Lu$^1$.

My CV (current as of July 1, 2022) is available here.
