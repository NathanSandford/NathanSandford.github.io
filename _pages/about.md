## My name is Nathan Sandford (he/him)

I am currently an Arts & Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto where I work primarily with Profs. Ting Li and Jo Bovy. I study the evolution of Local Group dwarf galaxies using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data, galactic and stellar models, Bayesian statistics, and novel machine learning techniques. 

I grew up in Santa Clara, CA where I attended Adrian C. Wilcox High School. I graduated from Pomona College in 2017 with a BA in Physics and Astronomy and a minor in Mathematics. While at Pomona, I studied the effects of feedback physics on the radial metallicity gradients of disk galaxies with Dr. Yu Lu. I then earned my MA (2018) and PhD (2023) in Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with Prof. Dan Weisz as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.
