## My name is Nathan Sandford (he/him)

I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in Prof. Dan Weisz's group in the UC Berkeley Department of Astronomy. I study the evolution of Local Group dwarf galaxies using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data, galactic chemical enrichment models, and stellar atmosphere and evolution models. 

Beginning in September 2023, I will be trading in my life-long California residency to move to the University of Toronto where I have accepted a postdoc in near-field cosmology with Profs. Ting Li and Jo Bovy.

I grew up in Santa Clara, CA where I attended Adrian C. Wilcox High School. I graduated from Pomona College in 2017 with a BA in Physics and Astronomy and a minor in Mathematics. While at Pomona, I studied the effects of feedback physics on the radial metallicity gradients of disk galaxies with Dr. Yu Lu.
